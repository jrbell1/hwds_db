# Hail and Wind Damage Swath (HWDS) Event Database
A 21-year climatology of hail damage swaths derived from daily MODIS imagery and storm reports. 

Hail and wind damage swaths (HWDSs) frequently occur during the warmest months of the growing season throughout the Midwest and Great Plains 
but are not yet officially documented or tracked like other severe weather impacts (e.g., tornadoes and derechos). The creation of a 21-year 
HWDS event database using archived daily storm reports and daily true color satellite imagery. Once the database was completed and underwent 
quality checks, the research team identified spatial and temporal trends from the confirmed swaths.

Version 1.0 to be released late Spring/early Summer 2023.
